# NN-Activation-Functions-and-Learning-Rates-on-Non-Linear-Pattern-Learning
Investigate the effects of different activation functions and learning rates on the ability of a NN to learn non-linear data patterns. The experiment involves generation of synthetic datasets featuring various geometric and non-linear data patterns for binary classification tasks using neural networks.
