# Impact of Activation Functions and Learning Rates on Non-Linear Pattern Learning in Neural Networks

### Abstract
- Investigate the effects of different activation functions and learning rates on the ability of a NN to learn non-linear data patterns.
- The experiment involves generation of synthetic datasets featuring various geometric and non-linear data patterns for binary classification tasks using neural networks.
- The testing loss, representing the mean squared error, was assessed across 36 treatments and blocking combinations.
- The experiment employs a factorial design and uses ANOVA with contrasts to analyze the main effects and interactions to identify significant factors influencing performance.
